## Assignment 2

I enjoyed this project and learning to use pair programming. I feel bad for the other two people on our team that weren't able to get together because they worked so much. We had a little bit of trouble pushing and pulling using Git Bash at first and we still don't know how to merge things. Once we had an entire problem get erased once for some reason. I would love a small video on the particulars of merging and maybe fetching if it is applicable.

For me, this assignment was rudimentary because I have worked with coding since I was 15, but overall I enjoyed the class. I can't wait to get to the actual pricing models.
