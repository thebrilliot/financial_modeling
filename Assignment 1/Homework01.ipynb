    "\n",
    "> Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "> While reviewing, the observer also considers the \"strategic\" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the \"tactical\" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.\n",

    "Pair programming is a very popular methodology used in software engineering and increasingly in data analytics and data science teams. The evidence shows that it helps to produce more correct software more efficiently. The evidence on its use in education is also strong. The consensus view is that it helps students more rapidly integrate the new concepts they are learning and to retain them longer. These two pieces of evidence together lend themselves to highly recommending their use for this course!\n",
